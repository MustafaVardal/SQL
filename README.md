# SQL Infos
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Here are some key points about SQL:

Data Retrieval: SQL allows you to retrieve data from databases using the SELECT statement. You can specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply filters using the WHERE clause, and sort the results with the ORDER BY clause.

Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database. The INSERT statement is used to add new records, the UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records, and the DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

Data Definition: SQL includes commands for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. The CREATE statement is used to create new tables or other objects, the ALTER statement is used to modify existing objects, and the DROP statement is used to delete objects.

Data Aggregation: SQL supports various aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX, which allow you to perform calculations and summarize data across multiple rows.

Data Filtering and Sorting: SQL allows you to filter data using the WHERE clause, which allows you to specify conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set. You can also sort the data using the ORDER BY clause, which allows you to specify the columns by which the result set should be sorted.

Joins: SQL supports different types of joins, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, which allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

Data Constraints: SQL allows you to define constraints on tables to enforce data integrity rules, such as primary key constraints, unique constraints, and foreign key constraints.

Transactions: SQL supports transactions, which allow you to group multiple database operations into a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that all the operations are completed successfully or rolled back if an error occurs, maintaining the integrity and consistency of the database.

Views: SQL allows you to create virtual tables called views, which are derived from one or more underlying tables. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, provide a customized view of the data, or restrict access to certain columns or rows.

Security: SQL includes mechanisms for managing user access and permissions to databases and tables. You can create user accounts, grant or revoke privileges, and implement security measures to protect the data.
